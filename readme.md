# SQL join workshop

In this database we are going to look into SQL joins and SQL functions using group by.

We will use the [chinook database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/);

To set it up follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/codex-academy/BasicExpressWebApp) to setup a database calles `chinook`.

And then run the script in the `sql` folder like this on the `chinook` database - it will run a minute or so it's a big database.

```
\i sql/chinook.sql
```


## Warmup SQL

Run some SQL statements to:

* Find out how many customers there are in the database.
* Find out how many employees there are in the database.
* Find all the artists
* Find all the media types
* Find all the playlist names
